Authen::SASL - SASL Authentication framework


DESCRIPTION
-----------

SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several network
protocols. Authen::SASL provides an implementation framework that all
protocols should be able to share.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

The following modules must already be installed before attempting to
build Authen::SASL:

  * Perl, at least version 5.14.0, with its standard modules:
    * Digest::MD5
    * JSON::PP
    * Test::More (for running tests only)
  * Digest::HMAC_MD5
  * GSSAPI (optional; for Kerberos v5 support)

INSTALLING
----------

Once the prerequisites are met the module is built and installed in the
standard manner:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Depending on how perl is set up, the last step above may require elevated
privileges.
